The Cs-137 soil contamination has detrimental effects on human health. The penetration and distribution of Cs-137 radionuclides at different soil depths were investigated. A portable open-source android program was developed to determine conversion coefficients, equivalent and effective dose values for four different phantoms.

The android version of the program provides users with much higher portability as the users can input the Cs-137 activity concentrations measured onsite and get the results rather instantly.
